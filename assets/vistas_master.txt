*** BOOK: VISTAS (SUPPLEMENTARY) ***

=== CHAPTER 1: THE THIRD LEVEL ===
AUTHOR: Jack Finney
THEME: Escapism, Intersection of Time and Reality.

SHORT SUMMARY:
Charley, a modern New Yorker, accidentally finds the "Third Level" at Grand Central Station (which officially has only two). It is a portal to 1894—a peaceful era before World Wars. He sees gaslights, handlebar mustaches, and a locomotive from the 1890s. He tries to buy tickets to Galesburg, Illinois (his peaceful childhood home) but realizes he has modern currency. He returns to the present but can never find the level again. Later, his sceptical psychiatrist friend Sam disappears and sends a letter (First Day Cover) from 1894, confirming he found the Third Level.

KEY POINTS & EXAM NOTES:
- **The Third Level:** A "waking dream wish fulfillment." A medium of escape from the "insecurity, fear, war, worry" of the modern world.
- **Description of Level 3:** Open-flame gaslights, brass spittoons, people with beards/sideburns, "The World" newspaper (June 11, 1894).
- **Galesburg, Illinois:** Symbol of peace, big old frame houses, huge lawns.
- **First Day Cover:** An envelope mailed on the first day of a stamp's issue (usually empty) to preserve the postmark.
- **Sam's Letter:** The twist. The rational psychiatrist succumbed to the allure of the past.

IMPORTANT QUESTIONS:
- **Q:** *Does the Third Level really exist?*
  **A:** Ambiguous. It could be Charley's hallucination (psychological escape) or a sci-fi time travel loop. The story suggests the latter via Sam's letter.

=== CHAPTER 2: THE TIGER KING ===
AUTHOR: Kalki
THEME: Satires on Power, Inevitability of Fate.

SHORT SUMMARY:
The Maharaja of Pratibandapuram is prophesied to die by a tiger. He vows to kill 100 tigers to disprove it. He bans tiger hunting, marries a princess from a tiger-rich state, and kills 99 tigers. The 100th tiger eludes him. Desperate, his Dewan plants an old, weak tiger. The King shoots, but the bullet misses (tiger faints from shock). The hunters kill it to avoid the King's wrath. Later, the King buys a crude wooden toy tiger for his son. A sliver pierces his hand, causes infection, and he dies. The 100th "Wooden" Tiger takes revenge.

KEY POINTS & EXAM NOTES:
- **Irony:** The King killed 99 real tigers but was killed by a wooden toy tiger.
- **Character of King:** Arrogant, willful, neglected duties (except hunting). "The Tiger King" is a mock-heroic title.
- **Corruption/Fear:** The Dewan and officers were so scared they hid the truth about the missed shot.
- **British Officer Incident:** King saved his throne by bribing the officer's wife with 50 diamond rings (3 lakh rupees).

IMPORTANT QUESTIONS:
- **Q:** *What is the satire in the story?*
  **A:** It ridicules the vanity of those in power. The King thought he could battle fate but died of a trivial infection.

=== CHAPTER 3: JOURNEY TO THE END OF THE EARTH ===
AUTHOR: Tishani Doshi
THEME: Environment, Climate Change, Earth's History.

SHORT SUMMARY:
Tishani Doshi joins the "Students on Ice" program led by Geoff Green, taking high school students to Antarctica. The goal is to show policymakers of the future the reality of climate change. Antarctica (coldest, driest, windiest) holds 90% of Earth's ice and is the best place to study the past (Gondwana) and future (Global Warming). She sees glaciers calving and walks on the ocean. The message: "Take care of the small things (phytoplankton) and the big things will fall into place."

KEY POINTS & EXAM NOTES:
- **Students on Ice:** Program to provide students educational opportunities and foster a new understanding of the planet.
- **Significance of Antarctica:** No human population, pristine. Holds carbon records in ice cores.
- **Phytoplankton:** Microscopic grasses of the Southern Ocean. They nourish the entire food chain and affect the global carbon cycle. Warning: Ozone depletion affects them.
- **Gondwana:** Ancient supercontinent. India and Antarctica were once part of the same landmass.

=== CHAPTER 4: THE ENEMY ===
AUTHOR: Pearl S. Buck
THEME: Humanity vs Patriotism, Medical Ethics.

SHORT SUMMARY:
Dr. Sadao Hoki, a Japanese surgeon during WWII, finds a wounded American POW (Tom) washed ashore. Torn between patriotism (handing him over creates death) and medical ethics (saving a life), he chooses to save him. His servants leave in protest. Sadao operates and saves Tom. He informs the General, who promises to send assassins to kill Tom quietly. The assassins never come. Sadao eventually helps Tom escape in a boat.

KEY POINTS & EXAM NOTES:
- **The Dilemma:** Throw him back to sea? Hand to police? Or Save him?
- **Hana's Role:** Stands by her husband despite fear. Washes the soldier herself when Yumi refuses.
- **The General:** Self-absorbed. He needed Sadao for his own surgery, so he didn't arrest him. He forgot to send assassins due to his own pain (selfishness).
- **The Conclusion:** Humanity transcends borders/war. Sadao wonders, "Why could I not kill him?"

IMPORTANT QUESTIONS:
- **Q:** *Why did the servants leave?*
  **A:** They were superstitious and patriotic; they felt staying in a house harboring an enemy was treason.
- **Q:** *Was Sadao a traitor?*
  **A:** No, he informed the General. But he was a Doctor first, and a human being who couldn't let a man die.

=== CHAPTER 5: ON THE FACE OF IT ===
AUTHOR: Susan Hill
THEME: Alienation, Acceptance, Physical Disability.

SHORT SUMMARY:
Derry, a boy with a burnt face (acid), creeps into Mr. Lamb's garden to hide. Mr. Lamb, an old man with a tin leg, engages him. Derry is pessimistic and hates people staring. Mr. Lamb is optimistic ("Beauty and the Beast," "Bees hum, not buzz"). Lamb teaches Derry that it's not what's on the outside, but inside that matters. Derry is inspired and decides to stop hiding. He returns to the garden only to find Mr. Lamb has fallen from his ladder and died. But Derry has changed forever.

KEY POINTS & EXAM NOTES:
- **Contrast:** Derry (Young, withdrawn, angry) vs Mr. Lamb (Old, social, optimistic). Both have disabilities but deal with them differently.
- **Lamb's Philosophy:** "Weed or flower? It's all life." "You can't lock yourself in a room" (Story of the man who died when a picture fell).
- **The Ending:** Tragic but hopeful. Lamb dies, but he passes his "life force" to Derry.
- **The Title:** "On the Face of It" refers to appearances. On the face of it, Lamb is just an old cripple, but inside he is full of life.

IMPORTANT QUESTIONS:
- **Q:** *How does Mr. Lamb try to remove Derry's baseless fears?*
  **A:** By talking openly, accepting him, and showing him that the world is full of beautiful things if one chooses to see them.

=== CHAPTER 6: MEMORIES OF CHILDHOOD ===
AUTHOR: Zitkala-Sa and Bama
THEME: Social Discrimination (Race & Caste).

SHORT SUMMARY:
Two autobiographical accounts of marginalized women. 
1. **The Cutting of My Long Hair (Zitkala-Sa):** A Native American girl in a boarding school. Her long hair (a sign of dignity in her culture, shingled hair = cowards) is forcibly cut. She feels like a "little animal driven by a herder."
2. **We Too Are Human Beings (Bama):** A Tamil Dalit girl sees an elder carrying food by a string to avoid "polluting" the landlord. She is amused, then furious when her brother explains Untouchability. He tells her: "Study hard. Education is the only way to gain respect." She follows his advice and tops her class.

KEY POINTS & EXAM NOTES:
- **Zitkala-Sa's Pain:** Loss of identity, cultural violation. "No one comforted me."
- **Bama's Awakening:** From innocence (laughing at the elder) to anger (wanting to touch the wadai).
- **The Solution:** Both writers used *Education* and *Writing* to fight back against oppression.
- **Common Thread:** Rebellion against social injustice and the trauma of childhood discrimination.

IMPORTANT QUESTIONS:
- **Q:** *What advice did Annan give Bama?*
  **A:** To study with care and learn. If she is learned, people will come to her.
