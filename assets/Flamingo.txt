*** BOOK: FLAMINGO (PROSE) ***

=== CHAPTER 1: THE LAST LESSON ===
AUTHOR: Alphonse Daudet
THEME: Linguistic Chauvinism, Procrastination, Patriotism.

SHORT SUMMARY:
Set during the Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871), the story narrates the last French lesson in Alsace, which has been captured by Prussians. Franz, a student who usually neglects his studies, walks into class fearing a scolding but finds a somber atmosphere. M. Hamel, the teacher, announces that an order from Berlin mandates only German be taught henceforth. This shock transforms Franz's attitude; he suddenly realizes the value of his language and regrets his procrastination. The village elders attend to pay respect. The story ends with M. Hamel writing "Vive La France!" on the board, symbolizing undying patriotism.

KEY POINTS & EXAM NOTES:
- **The Order from Berlin:** Only German to be taught in Alsace and Lorraine. This is the turning point of the story.
- **Atmosphere:** School was as quiet as a "Sunday morning". No commotion, no rapping of ruler.
- **M. Hamel's Dress:** Green coat, frilled shirt, black silk cap (usually worn on inspection days).
- **The Villagers:** Old Hauser and others sat on back benches to thank M. Hamel for 40 years of service and show repentance for not going to school.
- **Importance of Language:** Hamel calls French "the most beautiful, clearest, and logical language." He says, "When people are enslaved, as long as they hold fast to their language it is as if they had the key to their prison."
- **Franz's Reaction:** Books became "old friends". He forgot Hamel's crankiness. He understood everything that day (attentive listening).

CHARACTER SKETCH:
- **M. Hamel:** Strict, disciplined, but deeply patriotic and emotional. A true mentor who instills love for the mother tongue.
- **Franz:** A procrastinator ("I'll learn it tomorrow"), prefers outdoors, but sensitive and observant. He matures significantly in one lesson.

IMPORTANT QUESTIONS:
- **Q:** *Why did M. Hamel write "Vive La France!"?*
  **A:** To express his immense love for his country and defiance against the Prussians before dismissing the class.
- **Q:** *What is the "thunderclap" in the story?*
  **A:** The announcement that this was the "Last French Lesson".

THEME: Grinding Poverty, Child Labor, Stolen Childhood.

SHORT SUMMARY:
The chapter vividly describes the miserable lives of children in India. Part 1 is about Saheb, a ragpicker in Seemapuri (Delhi outskirts), who scrounges for "gold" (valuables) in garbage. He eventually takes a job at a tea stall but loses his freedom. Part 2 is about Mukesh in Firozabad, the hub of glass bangle making.

=== CHAPTER 3: DEEP WATER ===
AUTHOR: William Douglas
THEME: Conquering Fear, Resilience, Willpower.

SHORT SUMMARY:
An autobiographical account of Douglas's fear of water (hydrophobia). It started when he was 3-4 years old (knocked by waves) and cemented when a bully threw him into the deep end of the YMCA pool at age 11. He nearly drowned and developed a paralyzing fear. Years later, he decided to overcome it. He hired an instructor who taught him step-by-step. Finally, to ensure the terror was gone, he swam alone in Lake Wentworth and Warm Lake. He realized: "All we have to fear is fear itself."

KEY POINTS & EXAM NOTES:

- **The Instructor's Role:**
  1. Belt and rope (pulley) to swim back and forth.
  2. Taught exhaling underwater, inhaling above.
  3. Kicking legs to remove rigidity.
  4. "The instructor was finished. But I was not." (Douglas needed self-validation).
- **Final Victory:** Swam 2 miles across Lake Wentworth. Shouted "Gilbert Peak" echoes.

CHARACTER SKETCH:
- **William Douglas:** Persistent, courageous, analytical. He didn't just learn to swim; he conquered his inner demons.

IMPORTANT QUESTIONS:
- **Q:** *How did the instructor "build a swimmer"?*

=== CHAPTER 4: THE RATTRAP ===
AUTHOR: Selma Lagerlof
THEME: Universal Human Goodness, Trap of Materialism.

SHORT SUMMARY:
A vagabond peddler sells rattraps and believes the world is a giant rattrap offering "baits" (riches, food) to trap people. One night, he steals 30 kronor from a hospitable Crofter. He gets lost in the woods (his own trap). He takes shelter in an iron mill. The Ironmaster mistakes him for an old comrade and invites him home.

=== CHAPTER 5: INDIGO ===
AUTHOR: Louis Fischer
THEME: Leadership, Civil Disobedience, Self-Reliance.

SHORT SUMMARY:
Rajkumar Shukla, a poor sharecropper, persistently follows Gandhi to bring him to Champaran (Bihar) to solve the injustice of the Indigo arrangement. Peasants were forced to plant 15% land with indigo and surrender it as rent. Gandhi arrived, gathered evidence, and disobeyed a British order to leave (Civil Disobedience). His arrest led to thousands protesting. The British backed down. An official commission was set up. Landlords refunded 25%. Gandhi accepted it to break the deadlock and free farmers from fear. He also worked on social reforms (health, education) in Champaran.

KEY POINTS & EXAM NOTES:
- **The Issue:** 15% arrangement + Synthetic Indigo (Germany) rendered crop useless. Landlords demanded compensation to release peasants.
- **Turning Point:** Gandhi decided to *disobey* the order to quit Champaran. "The battle of Champaran is won" (when lawyers agreed to go to jail with him).
- **Why 25%?:** "The amount of the refund was less important than the fact that the landlords had been obliged to surrender part of the money and, with it, part of their prestige."
- **Self-Reliance:** Gandhi scolded lawyers for wanting Charles Freer Andrews (Englishman) to stay. "The cause is just; rely upon yourselves."
- **Social Work:** 6 schools opened. Kasturba taught sanitation. Doctors volunteered.

CHARACTER SKETCH:
- **Rajkumar Shukla:** Illiterate but resolute. His determination brought Gandhi to Champaran.
- **Gandhi:** Strategic, principled, focused on removing fear rather than just legal battles.

IMPORTANT QUESTIONS:
- **Q:** *Why did Gandhi agree to the 25% settlement?*
  **A:** To break the deadlock and prove that the British landlords could be forced to back down.
- **Q:** *How was Champaran a turning point in Gandhi's life?*
  **A:** It was the first successful experiment of Civil Disobedience in India on a mass scale.

=== CHAPTER 7: THE INTERVIEW ===
AUTHOR: Christopher Silvester
THEME: Journalism, Celebrity Privacy vs Public Interest.

SHORT SUMMARY:
